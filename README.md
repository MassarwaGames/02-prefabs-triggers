# Unity week 2: Formal elements

A project with step-by-step scenes illustrating some of the formal elements of game development in Unity, including: 

* Prefabs for instantiating new objects;
* Colliders for triggering outcomes of actions;
* Coroutines for setting time-based rules.

Text explanations are available 
[here](https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5782) in folder 04.

## Cloning
To clone the project, you may need to install git lfs first (if it is not already installed):

    git lfs install 

To clone faster, you can limit the depth to 1 like this:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/<repository-name>.git

When you first open this project, you may not see the text in the score field.
This is because `TextMeshPro` is not in the project.
The Unity Editor should hopefully prompt you to import TextMeshPro;
once you do this, re-open the scenes, and you should be able to see the texts.
